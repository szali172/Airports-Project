# CS 225 Data Structures

# Team Proposal (ai10-sali200-drugutt2-priyak5)

## Leading Question

Given a starting airport, what is the shortest path to visit every airport in the world once and return to the starting airport?

## Dataset Acquisition and Processing

one publicly accessible data set: airport data set
how you will download the data:
how you will store it:
how you will process it:
how you will handle potential errors:

## Graph Algorithms

graph data algorithm 1 (covered): Dijkstra's algorithm
inputs you want it to take in: Starting airport
output you are expecting for it: 
target big O:

graph data algorithm 2 (uncovered):
inputs you want it to take in:
output you are expecting for it:
target big O:

graph traversal:

## Timeline

### Week 1 (Nov 8th - Nov 12th):

***
### Week 2 (Nov 15th - Nov 19th):
We will experiment with the data and implement our dataset within C++. We will test to make sure the input and output works with a very basic test case, and we will start implementing our graph traversal along with possible our graph data algotirhms
*** 
### Week 3 (THANKSGIVING BREAK):
Relax.
*** 
### Week 4 (Nov 29th - Dec 3rd) [Mid-Project Check-in from Nov 29th - Dec 1st]:
We will continue working on our graph data algorithms and ensuring that the comparisons between the 2+ datasets are working as expected. During this time we will also focus on creating test cases and ensuring that our analysis is not breaking the functionality or manipulating our current database.
*** 
### Week 5 (Dec 6th - Dec 10th, Dec 13th) [FINAL WEEK]:
Final clean up with our algorithms and also finalizing our test cases.
