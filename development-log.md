# Development Log

## Nov 8th - Nov 12th
Worked on modifying our project idea and correcting the proposal.

## Nov 15th - Nov 19th
Decided to no longer use the original project idea and came up an entirely new one so the project is more manageable.  Selected a new data set (OpenFlights) and decided on a new project idea to find the shortest path to all airports given a starting airport.

## Nov 20th - Nov 28th
Thanksgiving Break

## Nov 29th - Dec 3rd
Worked out the details for the new project idea, completed and submitted the new proposal.  Set up the files for the project and started writing code for each file.
