# CS 225 Data Structures

# Team Contract (ai10-sali200-drugutt2-priyak5)

## Communication

1. **Team meetings:** Our team will have a short formal meeting (15-30 minutes) once a week to check in on each team member’s progress. This meeting will happen every Friday from 3-3:30 PM using Zoom. Everyone is required to attend this meeting. Our team will also try to set up a working meeting time at least once a week which is a time to focus on our project and deliverables. Everyone is expected to attend this meeting. Notes about every meeting will be stored on a separate Google document, where we will all have access to generate ideas about deliverables for the next meeting (through a DEVELOPMENT LOG entry).

2. **Assistance:** We have a group chat for us to contact each other at any time (Snapchat, GroupMe, and email if necessary). Group members are expected to respond within 24 hours of being contacted.

3. **Respect:** There will be no project leads. We will all make decisions based on group consensus. Everyone has an equal chance to speak and no one person’s decision has more power than another’s. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.


## Collaboration

1. **Work Distribution:** Each week we will create the deliverables (each will have an equal amount of work) and randomly assign them to all 4 group members. This makes the work distribution more even. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments can be made on a case-by-case basis.

2. **Time Commitment:** Each member is expected to work on the project two to six hours a week. If the deliverables take longer than six hours, the rest of the team should step in to help distribute the workload among the team members. Aside from special circumstances (which will be properly resolved on a case-by-case basis), it is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

3. **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts cannot be resolved internally, we will reach out to our mentor to act as a third party.
